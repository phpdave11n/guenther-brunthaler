This version-controlled branch (with UUID
qhs03buett12xusmwmh94jghc) contains a list of the newest commits
of most (optimally all) of my public repositories, for quick
update checks without polling individual repositories.

The basic idea has been borrowed from the lists of available
packages in many Linux distributions.

Instead of polling for updates from every version-controlled
branch which has been checked-out locally, just poll THIS branch
and update it if necessary.

Then you have a list of the latest commits, and can quickly
determine which of your check-outs is still up-to-date and which
ones are not.
