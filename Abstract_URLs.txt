Abstract URLs
=============
v2021.357

Whether they are hosted on GitHub or elsewhere, the repositories use an 
indirection step when used as remote URLs in a Git repository (or 
submodule).

This indirection consist of prefixing the GitHub repository basename 
with the constant URI-prefix

tag:xworld.mine.nu,2009:

This prefix can be redirected to GitHub using one the following sections in 
`~/.gitconfig`:

----
[url "git@github.com:guenther-brunthaler/"]
        insteadof = tag:xworld.mine.nu,2009:
----

for private read/write access, or

----
[url "https://github.com/guenther-brunthaler/"]
        insteadof = tag:xworld.mine.nu,2009:
----

for just public read access.

Similar redirections can be added for connecting to mirror- and backup- sites.
